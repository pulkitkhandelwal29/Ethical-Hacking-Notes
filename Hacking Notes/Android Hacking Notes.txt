**Instructions**
Payload can be injected with the original apk files using Fatrat tool
We can also use the GUI version of metasploit i.e. Armitage
Uploading of the backdoor apk on anonfile.com					//free file hosting website
URL can be changed using bit.ly shortener
We also need to enable port forwarding so that all the serivces comes to the Kali linux
Hacking with beef over WAN---we just need to put the public ip instead of private ip address
