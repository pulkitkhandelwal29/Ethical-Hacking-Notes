#Nmap`(Port scanner)
##Two types of Scanning
1.Passive scanning---In this scanning we do not want to be recognized by our target
Listen to the network traffic using wireshark or ARP tables

2.Active scanning--In this attack we send packages and also this creates traces
nmap,hping3,scapy,ping,tracert etc.


eg--wireshark &			//we use ampersand to make the process run in the background and also not let it run on the terminal
To know how many packets are being sent->statisctics>conversations


#Types of scan--
1.Ping scan			//-sn			(discover hosts)
2.Stealth scan		//-sS  (popular)(half open scan)
3.UDP scan			//-sU 


#Examples
>nmap -A 192.168.10.2							//aggressive scanning(powerful)(os detection)
>nmap -sS 192.168.10.12/24 -p 22.80,54-200		//in this "-p" parameter lets you scan the specific ports and in range
>nmap -n -Pn -sU -sV 192.168.100.2 --reason 	//it lets you know the reason why the port is open,closed or filtered
>nmap -sS 192.168.10.2 --top-ports 20			//top 20 ports will be displayed
>netstat -tnlp									//listening ports list
>service ssh stop								//stops the ssh service
>netdiscover									//discovers the hosts on the network

#Nmap scripting
Lua programming language
-sC       or    --script
/usr/share/nmap/scripts

nmap --script updatedb									//updates the nmap scripts
locate *.nse | grep telnet								//locating all the scripts
locate "vuln".nse										//this will locate all the files that have "vuln" in it and we can use 
														it with nmap
locate *.nse											//locates all the namp search engine scripts
eg:-nmap 192.168.10.2 --script [script name]


#Tasks you can do with NSE--
Network discovery
More sophisticated version detection
Vulnerability detection
Backdoor detection
Vulnerability Exploitation



#Bypass IPS/IDS---
Timing---Extend the duration between the packet, disable parallel scanning
-T 0 =paranoid
1 =sneaky
2 =polite
3 =normal
4 =aggressive
5 =insane

Fragmentation---	-f
Randomized scanning order	--- 			--randomize-hosts

>   --max-retries 2 			//no. of retries when there is no answer
>	--host-timeout 30m			//max. wait duration on host


Closing Parallel scanning-
--scan-delay 1					//wait before the next request is sent
--max-parallelism 1				//it sends one packet to one host at a time
--max-hostgroup 1				//one host at a time



#Nessus					//info of nessus
We need to download nessus from their official website
dpkg -i [nessus file]
Install the file and run the file
127.0.0.1:8834

Policy is the custom actions that we want to perform over the host
First define the policy and then the scan 
and also we can create the report and thus patch the system for the vulnerabilities



#Nmap tcp port scanning---
>vnc(virtual networking computer). It allows to remotely connect to the other computer<
We need to scan on the test machine or on the VPS server purchased by you
proxychains nmap -sT www.tline.tk

To connect to the SSH server---
telnet www.tline.tk 22








5. Scanning
Three way handshake -- Syn ---> Syn/Ack --> Ack

Netdiscover tool helps to know which hosts are active in an IP range

To find the ip of router-- netstat - nr


5.1 Nmap
nmap 192.168.1.1
nmap 192.168.1.1/24

nmap -sS 192.168.1.1  --- TCP syn scan (this scan does not establish connection with host)--send syn packet, get syn/ack and thats it
nmap -sT 192.168.1.1  --- tcp connect scan (performs tcp 3 way handshake) -- can be easily detected as it establish connection


**To check nmap in full detail** Go to man nmap

nmap -O 192.168.1.1   -- os detection
nmap -sV 192.168.1.1   -- version detection
nmap -A 192.168.1.1 -- covering (OS, version, scanning option)
nmap -p 80-100 192.168.1.1  --- to just scan port between 80 and 100


Port behind firewall, nmap reports them as filtered, meaning that packets sent to that port are dropped by firewall / IDS

*Bypassing Firewalls
nmap -f 192.168.1.1 				//creates tiny fragmented packets, but sometimes it does not work
nmap -D RND:5 192.168.1.1 			//creates decoys, and ip is scanned through any random 5 ip addresses (one will be the kali machine ip)   (best for public network)
nmap -D 192.168.1.2,192.168.1.3,192.168.1.4,ME 192.168.1.1 		//creates decoys, and ip is scanned through our defined ip addresses (ME--denotes that one will be the kali machine ip)			(best for local network)

nmap -sS 192.168.1.1 -T (timing parameter)			//paranoid and sneaky are used to bypass IDS 






6. Vulnerability Analysis
6.1 Nmap Scripts
All the scripts are here :- cd /usr/share/nmap/scripts/

nmap --script auth 192.168.1.1 -sS       (there are many scripts defined under category like auth, brute, banner, exploit etc.) (see documentation)


Running a single script
nmap --script firewall_bypass.nse 192.168.1.1			//script taken from the path above
(for to know what script does-- 		nmap --script-help [script name] )



6.2 Finding exploit manually
1. get the version name and then just search over google and write exploit
2. searchsploit [version name], u will get a path for the exploit file, locate [filename]


6.3 Nessus Vulnerability Scanner
