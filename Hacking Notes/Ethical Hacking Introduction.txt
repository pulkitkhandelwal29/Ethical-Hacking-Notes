#Ethical Hacking
Hacking Methods to discover weakness for system security
Ethical Hacker always needs an written contract to begin pentesting on the systems
Which is the most secure system?				//The one that is never built
Time is NOT on your side
Attacker has to find only 1 opening,we have to cover them all
Identity theft is the biggest problem in the world
A great attacker--Disable auditing->Do damage->Enable auditing


Five stages of Penetration Testing
>Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)----- Actively and Passively
>Scanning -- Deeper form of information gathering  using technical tools to find openings in the target. Openings can be gateways,open ports,operating systems that target runs. Vulnerability scanning is also performed
>Gaining access/ Exploitation
>Maintaining access-- Done by installing rootkits or backdoors
>Covering Tracks-- Removing everything which tells that any attack ever take place




#Types of hackers:
black hat
white hat
grey hat
suicide hackers
Script kiddies
State sponsored hackers,spy hackers

#Why hacker hacks?
Hobby
Illegal Activities
Malicious Intent
Gain Knowledge

#Skills for Ethical Hacker:

#Current Hacks going on:
DOS
Stock Manipulation
ID theft/Credit card theft
Piracy
Theft of Services
Vandalism(Deface)

#Hacking Phases---
Reconnaissance						//getting the information about the target
Scanning							//gathering info 
Gaining access						//via network,OS,application
Maintaning access					//PWNing a system,Use system as a launch pad,inject backdoor,Use resources,harden up,
Clearing Tracks						//seems like system has never been comprised,Destroy proof,hide particular stuff



#Covering the tracks
When we clear the logs it passes an entry that the logs has been deleted.

#Fundamentals of the Information Security--
Authenticity				//checking that the valid user wants to log on
Integrity					//checking the accuracy of data
Availability				//data is available at the right time
Confidentiality				//data is confidentially secured
Non-Repudiation				//no one can modify the data unless the accountability of the user


#Speak like a hacker:
Exploit						//way of breaching a system
Hack value					//value we get after the hacking of systems--significant
vulnerability				//weakness in the design of the system,environment
Target of Evaluation	
zero day attack				//Hacker can issue to a target the attack until the patch comes from the company--that something has 
							not been fixed
Daisy chaining				//using one node to attack another


#The technology triangle:
Usability(GUI)	>>Functionality(Features) >>>Security(Restrictions)


#Security Threats--
Host Machine			//footprinting,Physical Security,Passwords,Malware,DOS,Unauthorized access,Privilege Esclation,Backdoors
Natural 				//earthquakes,hurricanes,floods
Physical				//theft,Impact(Dropping laptop),Power,End of life(Hard disk should be destroyed)
Applications 			//bad Configuration,buffer overflow(storing more data than should be),Lazy coding,Data/input validation
Human					//Malicious employees,lack of training,Social Networking,hackers
Network					//Sniffing/eavesdropping,ARP poisoning,DOS,Spoofing

 
#Attack vectors			//from which areas can we get the attacks
>VM and cloud Environments
>Unpatched OS and softwares
>Social Network
>Internal Users
>Hackivism
>Malware
>Botnets							//read it
>Security Staffing
>Lack of security policies
>Compliance with regulations/laws
>Complexity of Network infrastructure
>Mobile Devices


#IPv6 issues:
>octacillion address
>every square meter of the earth 1024 address can be assigned
>Auto Configuration
>Incomptability of logging systems(old machines can't log ip address)
>Default activation
>Shortcuts					//IT persons will use simple ip to remember
>Bigger headers
>4 to 6 translation
>Multiple IP's per device		3 address single device//local link,global link,site address
>Network Discovery


#Hacking influence companies(secured)
>Customer private information
>Intellectual Property
>Down time/slow site
>Loss of Revenues
>Financial Information
>Reputation
>Loss of Business


#Attack types--
Application						//This attack is based on the vulnerability in the application
Misconfiguration				//Default settings are not changed leading to misconfiguration
Shrink-wrap	code				//This attack is executed when the developers use the code without getting the free script checked
O/S attacks						
Entry Points					//remote network,checking from inside and outside,Dial up connection,Local network,Stolen 
								equipment,Social engineering,physical entry


#Information security controls--
Hacking skills					//OS knowledge,Security awareness,Computer Professional,Networking is must,Management 
								skills,Patience,Software Knowledge,Registry entries,"Sherlock Holmes"
Multi-Layered Defense			//there should be layers for the defense
Incident Management				//Think outside the box,identify,analyze,Prioritize,resolve
Vulnerability Research			//Start thinking like a hacker,Learn new about vulnerability










#Sniffing attack:
Defend Sniffing attacks--
YOur job isn't to stop them.YOur job is to slow them down

Detecting sniffing methods:-
When we ping to the computer that is sniffing, we will send him the ping request and it will be rejected by it

Ways to defend--
Encryption
Static MAC of gateways (access point) leading to no man in the middle attack
Physical access
Upgrade to ipv6
Switch off 	network iD broadcast
Static ip's
static arp table
HTTPS
SFTP
VPN's/IPsec
SSL/TLS
Wireless security
Direct MAC retrieval
Tools used to detect which interface in network running in promiscus mode

Detect using nmap or zenmap for sniffing





#Defend Malware Threats:
Scanning the host
Antivirus best installed and up to date
Integrity checking of the files installed in your system
Interception of reuqest to OS						//if any alarm popups
Sandbox
Create a policy
Watch Downloading
Update software
Attachment issues
What's the source
Keep informed and updated about the vulnerabilities(its for the ethical hacker)





#Buffer overflow attack:
What happens in a buffer overflow--
It can happen that no bad effect at all
It can happen bad arbitary code execution
Information Corruption
Unexpected behaviour of program execution
Changes in program flow
Behaviour changes  may help defeat security features


What can you do with a buffer overflow--
unexpected program execution
Command and control of computer
unexpected network access by attacker
Pivoting to other network hosts
Information Corruption
Data exfiltration
Arbitary code execution
Privelege escalation
Command and Control


How to stop buffer overflows--
Safeguard the program and security controls	
Programmer write safer code,fix the code,have your code tested
System administrators find vulnerable programs,patch programs or remove them
Users should know about security issues,no use of untested software,no use of unverified softwares
Programmer verify data in memory,Use Buffer overflow detection


Buffer Overflow testing tools--
Ollydbg
Spike
Input testing values illegal characters and any other based on your wish





Defend Buffer Overflows--
Mitigation is to reduce the potentialharmful effects of a threat
Remediation is to recover from the effects of a threat and restore normal operation

BoF plans of attacks--
Input field
API
Malware
Email attachment

BoF attack payoff--
Privelege escalation for the attacker
Creation of user accounts
Command and control of the local system
Multiple system compromised and open to remote access
Temporary or permanent disablement of the system




BoF Countermeasures--
Countermeasures are reactive security controls
Host based security monitoring software--Firewalls and anti-malware software
Network based security monitoring software--Firewalls,proxies,intrusion detection/prevention
Countermeasures can't prevent all possible loss from a threat



Network intrusion Detection Systems--Snort.org
Firewall rules
There should be rules

Local buffer overflow Detection--
Host layer defenses
Anti virus Detection--Files, email attachments
Anti malware solutions--suspicious program behaviour
"ClamAV.net"		it can detect for buffer overflow


Host based intrusion detection system--
Anti virus from famous companies and they can detect buffer overflow and many other attacks
System logs must be checked


Alert when buffer overflow--
Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience toolkit(EMET)

Windows event messages--
In event report, we must look for
Source--Windows error Reporting
Event id-1001
Event Name:BEX
In problem signature, down below--
Stackhash Signature must be there

>>We can filter the event reports, for windows error reporting and can search for the specific word "stackhash"<<

DEP(Data execution prevention)










Defend against DOS and DDoS--Solution is always hidden in the base idea of the attack
A robust defense mechanism is multifaceted(multiple layers)
Preparation before an attack, is key

capacity>attack

Discovery an Attack pattern:
What type of attack is it?
Where it is coming from and what is it targeting?
Are there any unique signatures?
Unintentional DDoS vs malicious DDoS


Network level defenses--
It will block the malicious traffic on the network infrastructure only like firewall and attacker will not be able to touch the website

Hardware Appliances---Corero(it is an hardware, first line of defense)


Layer 4 countermeasures--
Disable all unused ports
Block unnecessary ports like ICMP(ping request)
Filtering ingress traffic			//blocking request based on reputation(again and again requesting)


Absorbing the attacks--
Pros-
No disruption for the legitimate users
Auto scale is simplified in the cloud era
Scaling buys you more time to determine other countermeasures to detect the DDOS attack

Cons--
Can become very expensive
May not be practical within a short timeframe
May not be practically feasible for a large enough attack



>>Application level defense<<

Preparing for DOS Resiliency--
Implement a DoS strategy well in advance of an attack
Defenses are good but do they actually work(make sure that the defense mechanism work if a fake attack is there)












We can prevent from being attacked--
Application whitelisting(restricting programs)
Patching applications
Patching OS
Restricting admin privileges

Hacking windows prevention---
Change your BIOS settings to require a password to change the boot order or boot device
Encrypt sensitive file and use a strong password



Hack a Mac with 1/1/4!
• One reboot
• One special key combo (Command+S)
• At the Terminal, type clear to clear the screen, then:
/sbin/fsck –fy
/sbin/mount -uw /
launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.opendirectoryd.plist
passwd
• Enter a new ‘root’ password, twice
exit
• Log in as root using the new password





#End Point:
End point is the devices that we use like phones,mobiles,targets.To protect them we use anti-virus,IPS,IDS, application whitlisting
We can't use the security strategy which is hard from the outside but nothing from inside.
Security strategy should be like an onion which is hard to bite on.

Security should be like---
Predict
Prevent
Detect
Respond
Recover

Security should travel with the endpoint devices






#Disk Encryption:
It is a technology to protect data by converting it into an unreadable readable format through encryption.So only authorized people that can read that data.

##Software based Disk encryption:
dm-crypt										//linux
LUKS(Linux unified key setup)					//linux	
VeraCrypt										
TrueCrypt										//we can also use it
CipherShed
BestCrypt
FileVault2
BitLocker										//its also good


Example of Ciphers---
AES(Advanced encryption standard)
Blowfish
Twofish
Serpent

Disk Decrpytion attacks:
>DMA(Direct Memory access) attack--Whenever the decryption of memory is performed then the key is in the memory, it has to be to view the files.Now the attacker if having physical access can insert into the USB and run tool called "inception" (github)
Disk encrpytion fails when the system is turned on
>"Passware Kit enterprise and Passware Kit forensic" paid tools that can decrpyt hard disk encrypted disk using bitlocker,truecrypt,FileVault2
>Cold Boot attack			//It can be possible to recover the key from memory shortly after the device has been switched off









#Antivirus
1.Signature Based			//In this the anti-virus companies used to catch virus based on their signatures. This method is only effective on known malwares that are there currently
2.Heuristic based--In this the anti-virus companies catch virus based on their code and given a percentage what damage it could do on the system.Every malware code is scanned. Overall structure of the code.Logic functions and type of data in the malware.It works on known malware and encrypted malware.Deep scan in the Heuristic method slows the machine down.
3.Behavioural analysis--The viruses are run on the virtual sandbox environment and watched how much attack they are doing on the file
Sandbox--"sandboxie"

>Ransomware		//breed of malware and this malware encrypts all our personal files with a key that is known by the hacker.
Ransomware doesn't require root level access to encrypt the file as the files are available on the user space 
There is high business of ransomware and how to protect against it?

>EPP(End-point protection products)
>Mac uses "XProtect" like microsoft uses "Defender"
>EDR(End-point Detection and Response)				//Next generation AV 
>"What you can't prevent, you detect and what you dont' detect, you want to respond and recover from"















#Threat Detection and Monitoring
Threat Detection Honeypot--They are kept in the network and are laid as traps for the attackers who are trying to break into the network.This method is known as Detection through Deception.They provide high alerts(quality alerts) and false positives
Using honeypots, we can detect them,delay them,waste their time,misdirect them
Fast and easy to deploy
Discoverable to your threats
Deployed in sufficient numbers and density
Deployed in the right location
Virtually no management
Reliable

User Preference	//what do users like the most


Tasks are goals user set in our system


Common errors in task creation--
Leading or too Descriptive
Asking specific question


Chunking --is the process of dividing characters into small chunks to remember
Chunks help the person to remember the words/passwords in the memory

Mental Models--
Combination of labels,affordances,constraints,conventions and 
mapping
visibility
Feedback




Learning Objectives
After the completion of this week, you will be able to:

Exercise design methodology to develop an interface
Choose appropriate design techniques for your task
See how design lessons apply to building secure systems


Intro to Design--
If you design with bankers,u need to work with bankers as you are not a banker
Observe each and every detail, what they need,what they use and small details are necessary and create personnas
What is your main goal of the design?is it features or security 
hardest part of the design is that it is not universal and it is just a messy as it depends upon the creativity

Design Methodologies--
Iterative Design--Requirements->Design->Development->Testing (In this we can go back and forth based on requirements)
We can go to earlier phases

System Centered Design--This design is based on the system and its resources.
User centered design--design based on the user needs and we need to know the user
Participatory design--design is done on the basis of participation the user and designer

Support Designers coming up with ideas


Brainstorming is the process of getting new ideas for better design
Good Brainstorming--
Capture ALL the ideas
Build off the ideas of the others
Build visual
WILD ideas, Remember?
One Conversation at a time
Headline, not whole story
Go for quantity
Success

>>>>It is not the consumer's job what they want<<<<Steve Jobs

User knows what bad is happening,but not what
User has good sensal strategies(worry more about sites with sensitive info)
Error message relies a lot of information users don't understand
Usable privacy and security










Learning Objectives
After the completion of this week, you will be able to:

Perform qualitative usability analysis
Run quantitative analyses
Execute a usability study
Read and analyze evaluations conducted by others

Simple and Natural Dialog
Minimize user memory load
Consistency
Feedback of the user
Prevent errors 
Provide help and documentation

Controlled Experiment--
State hypothesis
Identify dependent and independent variable
Design the experimental protocol
choose the user population
and then perform experiments on the mobile unlock with fingerprint and PIN authentication


usability Studies--How usable the security system are--
Define Taks
Develop Questionnaires

A/B Testing--
Put option A and B and see the performance of the user
A/B testing  allows you to check that by showing different versions of the site to people


>>Better Interface--More secure behaviour

















Learning Objectives
After the completion of this week, you will be able to:

Apply guidelines for creating usable security
Analyze the delegation of authority in secure systems
Understand how guidelines are applied (or not) in existing systems and how it affects usability

Usable Security Guidelines--
Authentication
Viruses
Spyware
Design secure systems with good usable

Mental Models--Understanding and Expectation of the user..Taking in account of the user in design 

Both the Usability and security should be embedded from the software designing itself from the beginning


Authority guidelines-
Provide the entry to the users who have the authority. No user is allowed if no authority is provided to the user

Authorization and Communication guidelines

Interface guidelines for Usable security-
Make it easy  for users to control access to their resources








Learning Objectives
After the completion of this week, you will be able to:

Describe many types of authentication mechanisms
Understand the usability of various authentication mechanisms and how they relate to security


Password should fit the required combination
password expire policy should be there

Password Attacks--
Human
Brute Force
Common Word
Dictionary Word Attacks


Two Factor Authentication-
Password + One time Unique code
Generated by
Device,Email,Text,App
RSA Secure ID


Biometric Authentication
>Fingerprint Recognition(Fast speed)
>Face Recognition
>Voice Recognition



Gesture Based Authentication-
>Keypad Patterns
>Free Form gesture











Learning Objectives
After the completion of this week, you will be able to:
Design usable privacy systems
Help users express privacy preferences
Evaluate the usability of privacy systems


Privacy is a kind of security
How users can access data,Person is properly authenticated or not
User want to protect their information
Should have the right to understand what happens of their data

>>>Always have a look on the privacy policies<<<
