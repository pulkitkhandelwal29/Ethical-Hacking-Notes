#Footprinting
Don't waste so much time in academic education,it's ordinary
Waste your time for your skill, it can make you extraordinary

#Two types of Footprinting:
Passive footprinting--using public information
Active footprinting--Social Engineering to the employees


#Footprinting techniques
Looking for people on the internet..and find out more and more information
Know about the company more			//job providing sites likes monster
Get the details from the social websites also like facebook, twitter
Netcraft
Maltego
Google dorking
whois
cqcounter.com/whois
truecaller
osintframework.com
whois cnn.com						//terminal command
robtex.com
mxtoolbox.com
Search for the exploited service like drupal in shodan

#Using Maltego
To gather information we need to use "Maltego"
We need to initialize it using a new graph
and then use the transform i.e. paterva and under this we can search for the information we want
We can also gather information on the specific person and also on the company or an entity
We should build an attack strategy based on the gathered info
If any entity is not added, then we can go to Entities>Manage entities and select from there accordingly
Gather as much as information we can gather, and try to establish a relation so that it is easy to make an attack strategy


#Scanning Network
"Sparta" tool is an information gathering tool which helps in scanning the networks
"nmap"

#OS fingerprinting tool 
>xprobe2
>nmap

>Find out the nameservers,mail servers of targets--(important)
we can get DNS records
host -t ns megacorp.one							//name servers
host -t mx megacorp.one							//mail servers
host -l megacorp.one ns2-megacorp.one			//this will fetch the ip address of that particular name server

>www.exploit-db.com								//have a lot of exploit database


#Scanning Devices and port discovery
>netdiscover	-r 192.168.1.1/24				//checking all the connected devices(using CIDR notation)
>nmap										//port discovery tool
port 135									//remote procedure call(msrpc)
port 139									//netbios-ssn
>"enum4linux" 								//tool used for scanning the host

#Enumerate Directory Structure
using owasp dirbuster tool where we can find out the different web pages available in website
worldlist directory:--/usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists
>For discovering sensitive files, we can use "dirb"....
syntax:-dirb [target/directory]

#Finding out the Hash Used
"hash identifier" 							//tool used to know which hash is used in particular thing

#Searching for specific exploit
we can search for the specific expolit using "searchsploit" in the terminal in the parrot OS
syntax---searchsploit trans2open


#Google Dorks							//Using advanced operators to define searches
site:www.lepide.com						//the sites will appear where the lepide is there in the site name
intitle:admin							//the "admin" title sites will appear
inurl:login.php							//the sites will appear where the login.php is there in the url
filetype:jpg xls						//all the sites having these type of files
intitle:"index of/admin" site:www.anything.com
filetype:pdf "Not for public release"


#Theharvester
theharvester is used to harvest the information 
theharvester -d lenovo.com -l 500 -b google	  //terminal command to find information about lenovo.com from google till 500 searches

#Enumeration
Enumeration in information security is the process of extracting user names, machine names, network resources, and other services from a system. All the gathered information is used to identify the vulnerabilities or weak points in system security and then tries to exploit it.
Technique usually conducted internally
Requires an internet connection
attacker directly queries there


Possible weakness for successful enumeration--
Email/business cards
Brute force active directory
DNS zone transfers
SNMP
Windows groups
Default passwords


DNS(Resolution from name to ip) Enumeration:-
Record Lookup
cache snooping
Google lookup
Reverse lookup
Zone walking			//knowing about the internal zone network and subdomains
zone transfers			//transfering of data of dns into another dns server

DNS records--
A						//hostname resolved to ip
AAA						//instead of ip4 it is ipv6
CName					//it is an alias of A record
MX						//mail exchange records
NS						//nameservers 
SOA						//Start of authority(primary record)
PTR						//reverse lookup
SRV						//service records. what machine is running which service


What can we learn from DNS--
Every single computer in network and its services running
Server names
Workstations
Which services are running on server


SNMP--Simple network management protocol

Security of SNMP--
Version 1			//simple/basic
Version 2			//same as v1 but enhancements
Version 3			//restricted user access,more privacy,data encryption,More complex to configure,need to disable v1/v2

Data collected from SNMP--
Routing tables,file shares,configuration settings,arp tables,traffic statistics

MIB(Management Information Base)
Is a virtual database that have description of network objects






SMTP(The protocol used for mail)
Uses MX records of DNS

What can we collect from SMTP--
Collection of names list
Collection of Valid users






NTP(Network Time protocol)
Synchronizing time across devices
Extremely important to directory services

What can we learn from NTP--
List of hosts
IP address
System Names
Operating systems





LDAP(Lightweight directory access protocol)
Microsoft Active directory
This stores users accounts


What can we get from LDAP--
Group names
User names
Account info
System names


DNS Enumeration--
nslookup
dnsrecon

NTP Enumeration--
"ntptrace" tool
"ntpdc" tool

NEtbios enumeration--
Netbios Enumerator GUI tool of windows
Superscan(same)





Defend Enumeration--
Default configuration and Netbios:
Change it
Be aware of your pockets
Turn of SMB


SNMP:
Turn it off if not needed
Version 3
Group policy "additional restrictions for anonymous connections"
Block port 161 tcp/udp
IPSec filtering and this allows the encryption between the agent and the server
Limit access to null sessions


LDAP:
Separate email names and logon names as the usernames
Use SSL en encrypt LDAP
Encrypt drives that store LDAP


NTP:
Watch your ports
Understand what software is installed
Check your master NTP

SMTP:
Disable open relays
Drop Unknown Receipents
Never include email server info in your email/posts





Defend Footprinting---
Do your own recon
lock ports via firewalls
Check services on webservers
Prevent search engines from caching
Disable directory listing
Configure internal and External DNS separately
Restrict input types(!;><)
Educate employees		"There is no patch for human stupidity"
Use encryption on files and folder and passwords
Avoid cross linking				//we providing path to the other website for information



Recon pentesting--
Information Leaking related to organization (everything..gather as much as you can)


What should be on the report--
Data found via search engines:
Employee details
Login pages
Intranet portals
Technology platforms

Data found via website:
Operating system
File system structure
Contact info
CMS info

Data found via public search:
Contact info
Birthday dates
Emails
Photos

Data found via email:
Ip address(headers)
GPS location
Authentication systems

Data found via competitive intel:			//small details are necessary
Financial info
Projects planned

Data found via google:
Vulnerabilities
Error message --sensitive data
File exposed
Pages with network and sensitive data(data from HR)

Data found via whois:
Domain names
DNS servers

4. Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)
*Active information gathering
>ping , nslookup
*Passive Information gathering
>http://ipinfo.info/html/ip_checker.php, whois

>Whatweb -- tool in kali linux
eg-- whatweb 192.168.1.1-192.168.1.255 --aggression 3 -v  --no-errors

>Gathering emails using Harvester and Hunter.io (paid one--in free one only 10 emails)
theHarvester

**There are many tools online, download using git clone. (RedHawk--another tool online)






#ends


>Reconnaissance and Information Gathering
* Ip address - ping www.google.com , nslookup www.google.com, whois www.google.com
* web scanner - whatweb --help (whatweb www.google.com -v) 			//verbose for better display
* home scan using whatweb - whatweb 192.168.1.1-192.168.1.192 --aggression 3 -v
* Gather emails using harvester - theHarvester --help (theHarvester -d www.google.com -b all) //sometimes it does not work great
* Gather emails using hunter.io - website to search (not free)
* Information gathering tools github (search it on github and find the tool and install it on kali linux)
* Finding usernames with Sherlock (github) - python3 sherlock.py





10.Information Gathering--
1.Passive recon--Getting information without actively participating with the target
Target validation-WHOIS,nslookup,dnsrecon
Finding subdomains-Google Fu,dig,Nmap,Sublist3r,Bluto,crt.sh etc.
Fingerprinting-Nmap,Wappalyzer,Whatweb,Builtwith,Netcat
Data Breaches-HaveIBeenPawned, Breach-Parse, WeLeakInfo etc.
2.Identify our target-Bugcrowd
3.Email address gathering--hunter.io
4.Breached Credentials--weleakinfo.com
5.Discovering subdomains--theharvester		//gathers information based on different search engines
						--sublist3r(better)			//apt install sublist3r
						--crt.sh(amazing)			--owasp amass(github)
						--tomnomnom httprobe	//takes a list of website and checks whether the website is live or not
6.Identify website technology--builtwith.com(website)		--wappalyzer(firefox extension)    --whatweb(kali linux)
7.Burpsuite--good interception tool		(burpsuite pro automatically tells vulnerabilities)
8.Gogle dorking--	site:tesla.com -www									
					site:tesla.com filetype:pdf				//best thing to search,google dorking
9.Utilizing social media--badges,software,team photos
