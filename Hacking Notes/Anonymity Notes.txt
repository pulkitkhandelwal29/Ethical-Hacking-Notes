#Anonymity

>To get the public ip from kali linux---curl ipconfig.me
(or from browser--what is my ip)

>Use of Proxies are highly discouraged--There are no known HTTP(S) or SOCKS4(a)/5 proxies that offer an encrypted connection between itself and the user. Therefore, the Internet Service Provider or any man-in-the-middle [archive] can see connection details, including the destination IP address. If the destination server is not using SSL/TLS, then the entire content of traffic is vulnerable as well.(We use proxychains using tor relays so no worry)(If we used proxies manually then it is at high risk)(Same like in anonsurf)

>Use of Macchanger to anonymize the NIC

There are Different ways to Anonmyize in Kali Linux:-
1.Anonsurf github repository
and then proceed with ./installer.sh and then we can just
anonsurf start 					//this will start the script using tor and proxies
anonsurf change
anonsurf stop

2.Whonix(There is personal VM of it to anonymize Kali linux)


3.Proxychains
To enable proxies--/etc/proxychains.conf
We need to uncomment "Dynamic chain"
We need to uncomment "Proxy DNS"
In the end add a line for socks5 127.0.0.1 9050
and then save the file

and service tor start							//it is there pre-installed in the kali linux
proxychains firefox 				//to check proxies


3. TOR(The onion router)
We need to install tor browser from the official website  
And tor service can be installed using the terminal 

3.1 Hosting tor website--
cd /etc/tor
nano torrc
and go to the hidden tor services
and uncomment those 2 lines :-
Hidden services dir		/other hidden services
and then run "tor"

3.2 TO get the onion website link--
/var/lib/tor/other hidden services
cat hostname						//will give the link
service apache2 start				//will start the web server

>If any error comes related to tor--go to browser>start tor browser
edit it and then check for the condition to be run as root and change it

3.3 Hosting Darknet website/Own onion----
Goto Tor Browser -> Browser-> Data ->Tor ->torrc file

In the file edit at the end of the line--
HiddenServiceDir c:\Users\Gautam\hidden_service
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80								//port no. and the local ip after xampp s running(all features)

Make the html file in htdocs and start tor browser
When you will start tor browser then in the "hidden_service" folder "hostname" file will be created and copy the hostname and let it run in the tor browser and the html file will be running and thus tor website is running.





5. VPN for Linux
Type "openvpn" in the terminal and with it the file of the openvpn book
To connect to the open vpn i.e. vpnbook
We need to download the course bundle
Then extract it
In the terminal,type--
openvpn [any file name from the 4 file name]
and it will ask for the authentication that can be copied from the website
and for the initialization sequence completed
 





**DNS**
Domain Name server,ISP keeps the track of DNS and it is by default theirs or google
It is impotant to change the DNS resolving IP address of the computer and it will lead to the anonymity
Open DNS					//It keeps the browsing private
Cloud fare New DNS			//1.1.1.1

1.1 Changing DNS in kali linux---
nano etc/resolv.conf							//configuration file of DNS

This DNS configuration change is automatically done by anonsurf


***************************************************************************************************************
#Extra
>To remain anonymous we need to place "proxychains" in front of the command so that our ip address is not revealed
>We can set the proxy also in kali linux in the network tab							//we should avoid proxy and use vpn instead
In proxy the ISP can see the traffic as it is not encrypted but in vpn the traffic is encrypted
use tor to hide from isp 
>using "macchanger" we can change the mac address
>using tor to vpn is the safest as it confirms that there is no malicious users at the end of tor network		//first tor is connected to the network and then the vpn
>but we can use in case we want to use vpn to tor
>airvpn is best and we need ddns for being persistence in the connection
>airvpn port forwarding and while other port forwarding can be done by router and not in mobile hotspot


>anonymous:-
tor over vpn is the best combination 
hide your dns by /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf
have a look on the nameserver by /etc/resolv.conf
/etc/proxychains.conf(dynamic chain)







**Section for Dark Web**
Deep web---
90 percent of the oceans remain unexplored, unseen by human eyes
Traffic in the deep websites has increased
IT can ber accessed by search engines but it needs to have access
It contain government databases
Academic information,Medical Records,Legal Documents,competitor websites,usernames and passwords



Darknet----
Here we can buy gun,drugs,hitman,hacked paypal accounts etc.
Drug trafficking sites,Private communications,Illegal information,Tor Encrypted websites


Currency used in Darknet----(cryptocurrencies are untraceable)
Bitcoin
Litecoin
Peercoin
Primecoin
Ripple
Quark



To trace information of IP address--
cqcounter.com -> whois


Using duck duck go to enable privacy

Facebook over TOR----https://facebookcorewwwi.onion/

Accessing email over tor---torbox3uiot6wchz.onion

Darknet search engines---haystak

Darknet Links---
reddit.com
torhiddenwiki.com


How to sieze Darkweb websites---
Either arrest that guy who is hosting the website or find out the vulnerability so that it can be hacked and bring down the website
